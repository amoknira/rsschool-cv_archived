### About me ###
I graduated electrotechnical University in 2019 as an engineer, however I always was interested in programming. I was acquainted with Pascal and C++ - we coded with it in the school and university, but some time later I started to learn Java and then have understood that I'm more attracted to web development.
I have B2 level in English, I lived in british family in Eastbourne for a month and studied there in english-school with native teachers.
My strengths are responsibility, fast learning anf team working asa well as problem solving.

Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

```
String.prototype.toJadenCase = function () {
    let words = this.split(" ");
        for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            words[i] = words[i][0].toUpperCase() + words[i].substr(1);
        }
    return words.join(" ");
    }
```
